# MSc-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science

## Year 1 (2022-2023)

- Applicable Maths
   - A Review of Calculus, Linear Algebra, Matrix Decomposition, Introduction to Probability Theory, Random Variables & Probability Distributions, Concentration Bounds & Convergence, Stochastic Processes, Sample-Based Statistics, Optimisation, Distance Functions
- Programming for Data Science
   - Basic R and Python, namespaces, vectors and matrices, random number generation. File formats, data frames and APIs. Graphs and Time series. Objected-oriented programming. Version control with Git. Debugging, profiling and defensive programming. Unit testing. Packaging code for others. Generators. Awareness of challenges in software development for data science.
- Ethics in Data Science and Artifical Intelligence (Part 1 and Part 2)
   - **Part 1** begins by discussing the ethical use of data itself - the  raw materials of data science pipelines. It then discusses sets of  principles that tech leaders and international bodies are adopting to  promote ethical use of data science and artificial intelligence  algorithms, including a discussion of real-world examples of failings  and adverse outcomes.
   - **Part 2** revisits the issues explored in Part 1 in  greater technical detail. This part introduces data science  methodologies that provide novel solutions to ethical problems of old  such as explainability, prejudice and bias.
